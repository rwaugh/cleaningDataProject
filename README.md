cleaningDataProject
===================

Final project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-002)

This projects takes accelerometer data and creates averages of the variables using R.

## Raw Data

The raw data for this project comes from the
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
which measured information from accelerometers on Samsung Galaxy S smartphones that had been attached to 30 different subjects as they engaged in 6 different activities.

1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

The data archive was downloaded from the following URL on April 27, 2014:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This file must be placed in the working directory before the R program is run. The file is unzipped by the R program in this repository. Only six files are of interest in this analysis. These contain training data and test data which will be joined.

- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"
- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"
- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt"
- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt"
- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"

## Files in Repository

This repository contains three files.
1. This README.md file describing the project and how it was completed.
2. The output file, tidyData2
3. The R script, run_analysis.R which processed the data.

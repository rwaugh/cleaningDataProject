===================

Final project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This projects takes accelerometer data and creates averages of the variables using R.

## Raw Data

The raw data for this project comes from the
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
which measured information from accelerometers on Samsung Galaxy S smartphones that had been attached to 30 different subjects as they engaged in 6 different activities.

1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

The data were downloaded from the following URL:

This file is placed in the working directory and is unzipped by the R program in this repository.
